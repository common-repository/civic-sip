Civic Secure Identity Platform (SIP) authorization plugin. Sign in to your blog using Civic Mobile App.

== Description ==

Allow users to securely login and register for your site using the <a href="https://www.civic.com/secure-identity-platform">Civic Secure Identity Platform</a>. To get started, you will need to register with the <a href="https://www.civic.com/app">Civic app</a> and then use the app to log into the <a href="https://sip-partners.civic.com/">developer portal</a> to obtain your App ID and API keys.

Note: This plugin requires that the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.gmp.php">php-gmp extension</a> is installed
on your WordPress server. PHP version 7.x is required. For PHP 5.6 compatibility, use plugin version 1.x.

The latest source code and development progress is available on <a href="https://github.com/blockvis/civic-sip-wp">GitHub</a>.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/civic-sip` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Set app id, private key, public key and secret in 'Civic QR Auth' settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to display "Sign In With Civic" button on WP login/registration page? =
The "Sign In With Civic" button will be displayed on the login and registration pages after the plugin is activated. You can hide the button by switching off the "Show Civic Sign In Button" setting.

= How to display "Sign In With Civic" button on other pages? =
You can place `[civic-auth]` shortcode in your templates to display "Sign In With Civic" button.

= How could I implement custom authentication workflow? =
If you see some important functionality is missing, feel free to open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/blockvis/civic-sip-wp/issues">GitHub</a>. Otherwise you can implement your custom authentication workflow by hooking to the `civic_sip_auth` action. Remember to disable default workflow by switching off "Enable WP User Authentication" setting first. In this scenario requested scope data will be passed directly to your callback function.
